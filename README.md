# auto-ML-webapp

This platform is built using Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, and Poetry. It is designed to allow users to easily build and train machine learning models without the need for extensive programming knowledge.

With our platform, users can upload their own datasets, select the type of model they want to build, and let our platform handle the rest. Our platform uses scikit-learn to train and evaluate the models, and Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform. We also use pandas to preprocess the data and Poetry to manage our project dependencies.

Whether you're a seasoned machine learning expert or a beginner just starting out, our platform is designed to make the process of building and training machine learning models as easy and intuitive as possible. We hope you find it useful!

## Current options:
`Data upload` - upload almost any CSV format data and it will build a Pandas dataset from it
`Profiling` - it is able to perform automated exploratory data analysis
`Machine Learning` - automatically train different ML models on the dataset and show the results for each
`Download` - download the selected model
